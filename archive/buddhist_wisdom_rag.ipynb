      "I’m sorry you’re feeling anxious — that’s a difficult place to be, and it matters that you noticed it. Thank you for being honest with yourself. I’m with you in this moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "A teaching from the Buddha that may be helpful is that much of our suffering comes from resisting what is happening now or getting pulled into worries about the future or regrets about the past. Anxiety often feels like being swept away by thoughts. But we can learn to be a gentle observer of those thoughts and sensations, like watching clouds pass across the sky.\n",

      "2. Notice physical sensations (without judging them)  \n",
      "   - Ask yourself: “Where do I feel this anxiety in my body?” Maybe your chest is tight, your stomach is fluttering, or your shoulders are tense. Simply notice those sensations as if you’re describing them to a kind friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Observe your thoughts like clouds  \n",
      "   - Let thoughts come and go without chasing them. You might silently name them — “worry,” “planning,” “what if…” — and imagine them as clouds passing in the sky. They don’t need to be acted on right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Return gently to the breath and be kind to yourself  \n",
      "   - Use the breath as an anchor. When your mind wanders (and it will), gently bring attention back to the feeling of breathing. Hold a soft, caring attitude toward yourself — not forcing calm, just being present with what is.\n",
      "\n",
      "A short, 3-minute practice you can try now:\n",
      "- Sit comfortably. Close your eyes if that feels okay. Take three slow breaths.\n",
      "- Spend the next minute noticing where tension lives in your body.\n",
      "- Spend the next minute noticing thoughts as they appear and letting them go like clouds.\n",
      "- Spend the final minute returning your attention to the breath and offering yourself a kind phrase such as, “May I be gentle with myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional supports that help:\n",
      "- Move gently (a short walk or stretching) to shift energy.\n",
      "- Tell a trusted friend or write down what you’re feeling — naming it can reduce its intensity.\n",
      "- Reduce stimulants like excess caffeine if you can, and try to rest.\n",
