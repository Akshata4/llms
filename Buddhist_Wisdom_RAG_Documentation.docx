Buddhist Wisdom RAG System Documentation

Overview
This document explains the implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides Buddhist-inspired guidance for emotional concerns. The system combines Buddhist teachings with modern AI technology to offer personalized, compassionate advice.

Components and Implementation
1. Data Source
   - The system uses a text file (buddhist.txt) containing Buddhist teachings
   - Topics include: The Four Noble Truths, mindfulness, anxiety management, and daily practices
   - The text is structured to provide both philosophical context and practical advice

2. Technical Architecture
   a) Document Processing
      - Loads Buddhist teachings from text file
      - Splits content into meaningful chunks
      - Creates embeddings for semantic search
   
   b) RAG Implementation
      - Uses LangChain for the RAG pipeline
      - Employs OpenAI's embeddings for semantic search
      - Implements fallback local embeddings for testing
      - Uses a custom prompt template for compassionate responses

3. Key Features
   - Semantic search in Buddhist teachings
   - Context-aware response generation
   - Fallback system for offline testing
   - Compassionate and accessible response formatting

Step-by-Step Workflow
1. Loading and Preprocessing
   - The system loads the Buddhist text
   - Splits it into chunks of ~500 characters with 100-character overlap
   - Creates document objects for processing

2. Vector Store Creation
   - Generates embeddings for each text chunk
   - Stores them in an in-memory vector store
   - Implements fallback embeddings for reliability

3. Response Generation
   - Takes user's emotional concern as input
   - Retrieves relevant Buddhist teachings
   - Generates compassionate, contextual responses
   - Grounds advice in Buddhist philosophy

Usage Example
Input: "I am feeling anxious"

Technical Requirements
- Python environment with:
  - langchain
  - openai/langchain-openai
  - python-dotenv
  - Other supporting libraries

Configuration
- Requires OpenRouter API key in .env file
- Uses GPT-4 Turbo for response generation
- Configurable chunk sizes and overlap
- Customizable prompt templates

Best Practices
1. API Key Management
   - Store API keys in .env file
   - Never commit sensitive credentials
   - Use environment variables for configuration

2. Error Handling
   - Graceful fallback to local embeddings
   - Clear error messages
   - Robust exception handling

3. Response Quality
   - Maintains Buddhist terminology while being accessible
   - Balances philosophy with practical advice
   - Ensures compassionate tone

Adding Your Own Content
To extend or modify the system:
1. Edit buddhist.txt to update teachings
2. Adjust chunk sizes in the notebook
3. Modify the prompt template for different response styles

Future Improvements
1. Add more Buddhist texts and teachings
2. Implement source attribution
3. Add multi-language support
4. Create a web interface
